In the Year 2015 I create an online multi-sig wallet containing around 200.000 Dogecoin (worth ~25â‚¬ at the time),
I managed successfully - as actually planned! - to forget about it til recently.
Sadly the way I remembered was the information that the service is being shutdown and there is only very low time left til they go offline.

I didn't manage to find my wallet password in time, but the owners told me to contact them once I find my password.
This password is one of the 2 private keys needed for the wallet, the other can be retrieved this first key if the site owners keep their word.

After a lot of digging I found a few clues about the password - but sadly those hints are cryptic themselves , using probably rather simple cyphers I came up with myself

This repository contains the hints I found, some general information about the password and a json file with one of the private keys as encrypted passphrase + encryption algorithm information. (so password guesses can be tested against this).
