Montag, 13. April 2015 11:36:19;more work on decoupling
Montag, 13. April 2015 16:39:03;further decoupling, changed from interface to abstract class as Unity Inspector does not show interfaces...
same commit, 2nd line);fixed performance bug where tilemap was updated way too often instead of all at once.
Montag, 13. April 2015 19:20:48;decoupled tilemap visuals from tilemap manager.

Donnerstag, 16. April 2015 21:52:19;refactored one time tile effectors and tilemapmanager to avoid frame delay and trouble. Way easier solution now.
same commit, 2nd line);Weapons with multiple rays/projectiles dont use more than remaining in shared clip now.
Freitag, 17. April 2015 15:48:07;changed way hitscanning for targets and obstacles works. Now uses 2 rays. Makes things better.
Samstag, 18. April 2015 18:06:15;HitScans are a static class now, as lots of different systems are going to use hitscans. added reflection to hitscan weapons using recursion. Still needs a max amount of reflections. probably best to replace  isReflecting with an integer and decrement it till it is not reflecting anymore.
Montag, 20. April 2015 10:45:55;started working on changing how weapons work once again. should be even better and more flexible then.
Montag, 20. April 2015 19:02:42;emergency commit, laptop might explode soon.

Donnerstag, 23. April 2015 11:08:08;distinction between triggering and affecting layers for splash effects.

Freitag, 24. April 2015 00:00:34;started working on implementing Projectile Trajectiles :D
Freitag, 24. April 2015 15:45:50;removed hitscan and projectileweapon as weapon just contains differrent trajectiles now so we dont need to distinguish on that level.
Freitag, 24. April 2015 16:18:37;Effects not have different Methods for Beams and Projectiles - handling them equally does not work so well.
Samstag, 25. April 2015 11:22:26;cleaned up folder structure a bit,
same commit, 2nd line);added a ScanSphere Hitscan option which uses a sphere sweep so beams can have a thickness.
same commit, 3rd line);Added a Multiply Trajectile Effect Modifier.

Montag, 11. Mai 2015 19:21:11;Cone Damage now works. Refactored into own Trajectile Type instead of being an effect.
Montag, 11. Mai 2015 21:54:46;added cone transmittter prefab.
Dienstag, 12. Mai 2015 10:42:44;refactored different Transmitter shapes to all work like Trajectiles before.

Freitag, 15. Mai 2015 18:17:54;ring drawer now works, can also draw ring segments.
Freitag, 15. Mai 2015 19:49:56;cone provided wrongfully only angle from center instead of total angle to conedrawer. Should eventually all be be more consistent :D
Freitag, 15. Mai 2015 22:40:36;added a beam which has a splash effect at the end. right now when reflecting it triggers every time. Needs fix.
Samstag, 16. Mai 2015 08:44:48;reflect and piercing now have an option to trigger all untargetted effects if remaining reflects or piercings are 0.
Samstag, 16. Mai 2015 08:55:14;bugfix: range of splash transsmitters now longer overridden by splasheffect range. removed that field from splashEffect, merely acts as container to keep transmitter now.

Montag, 18. Mai 2015 09:55:26;fixed "=" instead of "==" in remove linq expression, now need to add ignore list for already hit targets for bounce effect.
Montag, 18. Mai 2015 13:32:11;bounce effect now works :-)
Dienstag, 19. Mai 2015 18:52:03;projectile piercing and reflect now works properly. Bounce still needs to be done.
